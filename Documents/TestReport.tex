	\section{Introductions}
	\subsection{Objective}
	The main functions that are being tested are Player moves, Player betting, management of chips, management of pot, card distribution and hand ranking; these are all tested using Junit. Also included in the test report is the results of manually testing the GUI and the results of a usability test, which was surmised through surveying five people. The testing produced no errors and the usability test result met the acceptable criteria stated in the requirements document.
	\subsection{Method of Testing}
	Testing will mostly be done through automated unit tests using JUnit, with some manual testing, and some whitebox testing in order to validate actual outputs with the expected outputs in order to verify quality, robustness, and functionality. \\
	There will be many test cases including extreme and abnormal cases done through automated testing because the software should produce predictable and consistent results for most cases. Tests that cannot be tested using automated tests such as the user interface will be done through manual testing as automated tests is not feasible for the user interface. The manual tests will provide us with insight from the user on how it can be improved and also to test the interface to see if everything looks and feels the way it should. \\
	 The software can/will be installed on any system that runs Java all tests performed to date are done in Windows. The tests were performed through the Eclipse IDE and the operation environment will be the same in terms of the operating systems, but it will not be run through Eclipse. All automated tests are completed with the use of JUnit, which performs unit tests for individual method(s) within modules.

	\section{Nonfunctional Quality Tests}	
	\subsection{Usability Tests}
	Usability Tests are performed by recruiting 3 complete beginners with no knowledge of the game as well as 3 people who are already familiar with the game. The participants were given a series of tasks to perform. The amount of time required for them to complete the task as well as comments to the task are recorded. Participants will not be named to protect their identity. Further discussion of the results can be found in section 7.1.

	\subsection{Performance Tests}
	Performance tests are to be performed using JUnit and a StopWatch library to measure the time required to execute certain actions. Each JUnit test will run 10 times and if the average is within acceptable range, then the test passes. It is important to note that the performance may vary depending on the user's hardware, so for consistency, the tests will be conducted with the same machine. Further analysis can be found in section 7.2.

	\subsection{Robustness Tests}
	To test for robustness, JUnit will be used to manually trigger events in which an error is produced which should be caught and displayed to the user. The results of such tests can be found under section 5.
	\section{Automated Unit Tests}	
	Unless otherwise stated, all results here were generated using Automatic testing using junit. These tests included several inputs (both normal and boundary), as such only the types of inputs/outputs are stated here and only one specific input and specific output is shown as an example for each test.

	\section{Changes Due to Testing}
	The tests reported here are only for revision 1 of the software, each previous version of the software after revision zero also had these same tests applied to them. The software was only deemed complete and up to the standards set out by the requirements document when all tests returned expected results. Therefore each test that produced results that were not deemed correct changed the software until it was fixed. \textcolor{red}{Additional rules are added to better capture the overall core gameplay. The UI was slightly changed to display more effective information. New functions such as flipping the dealer's cards at the end of the round was added. }
	\section{Test Summary}
	\subsection{Usability Tests}
	Six participants were timed and observed while they perform tasks given by us within the program. We found that the results were well received, with minor complaints about the user interface. \\
	\newline
	For the game playing portion, the participants felt that the program was easy to navigate and the elements of the game were not hard to find on the user interface. The gameplay was smooth with minor issues that we have later resolved. \\
	\newline
	The help and rule page was met with little difficulty, the participants were easily able to pull up either pages and find the basic rules they needed to play the game. Some of the participants have found that the game or the pages are too simple. While we agree that it may be simple, but the idea is to not overwhelm the player with an absurd amount of information to digest, especially not with the beginners. It is true that Texas HoldEm is a complex game, we feel that if a player is armed with the basic knowledge and continuously practice by playing the game, they can understand the game and slowly but eventually come up with strategies on their own. Of course, for more advanced tactics, they would have to do their research but this game is not about having the best and smartest opponent to face but more of something that can be used to ease the transition between beginner and a seasoned player. \\
	\newline 
	The participants were overall satisfied with the current state of the game and have made suggestions toward the improvement of the user interface. Their suggestion will be taken into consideration however there are no plans to implement any changes to the user interface at the present time.
	\subsection{Performance Tests}
	The performance tests were conducted in order to determine whether the user can the program in a reasonable time frame and also to see if the program can output the required actions in reasonable time. Our tests have shown that the software passes in these aspects and we have ideas on how to optimize the performance further however there is no plan to implement the ideas at the present time as the current system have exceeded the expected results. 
	\subsection{Robustness Tests}
	The tests were conducted in JUnit where all possible and foreseeable errors were manually triggered and the results recorded. We found that we were able to catch and output all errors that can occur and no game actions were performed when errors occurred, therefore keeping the system error free. During manual testing, no errors were found that are not already included in our tests.
